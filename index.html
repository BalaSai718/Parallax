                Inazuma Eleven Go (イナズマイレブン GO, Inazuma Irebun Go, lit. Lightning Eleven Go) is an anime based on the Inazuma Eleven GO (manga). 10 years after the FFI, an 
                unnoticed darkness lurks behind the country. Japan and what used to be soccer has changed during the 10 years that have passed. In this time, soccer is different from 
                before and has become a reason for people to lose hope and stop playing for those who enjoy soccer. The new main protagonist, Matsukaze Tenma tries out for the Raimon 
                soccer team and passes but in a match with another team, he soon realizes that soccer is much different from what he has expected it to be. Now, soccer in Japan is 
                controlled by an organization called Fifth Sector and is led by the one known as the “Holy Emperor”, namely Ishido Shuuji (who is later revealed to be Gouenji Shuuya).
                Soccer in its current state is controlled and gives out commands whether the team loses purposely or wins the match. What used to be the “real soccer” is gone
